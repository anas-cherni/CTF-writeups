>Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites.
>Competitors steal flags either from other competitors (attack/defense-style CTFs) or from the organizers (jeopardy-style challenges).
>In this repo, I am writeups for the most interesting web challs I encountered.
